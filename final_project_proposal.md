## The tentative project title

Preliminary Exploration of Regional Differences and Influencing Factors
in Government Corruption Index

## The motivation for this project

“We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public
office.” - Aesop

The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) measures the perceived levels of
government corruption in different countries.

The government corruption index seems very far away from us, but as
socially concerned students, we want to explore some of the subtle and
deep factors behind the index and the reasons for regional differences.
And by visualizing the results to deepen the understanding of the index
for people who see the report.

## The intended final products

The final project will cover following  
**Data**:  
- Description of data and variables  
- Data cleaning and manipulation

**Data Visualization**:  
- Use a variety of graphs and tables to present our findings.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis.  
- box plots and histograms  
- A map of the world corruption levels

**Analysis**:  
- Figure out factors related to corruption index  
- Statistical analyses such as several kinds of hypothesis tests.

**Regression Model**:  
- Build a basic regression model  
- Model improvement, model diagnostics and predictions

## The anticipated data sources

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Analyses： We will try to figure out factors related to corruption
index. We will model the relationship between corruption index and some
variables within countries year by year. These variables include
government effectiveness, voice and accountability, economy stats such
as GDP per capita, development indicators such as education, etc.
Corruption index will also be analyzed by continents. We might also do a
cluster analysis to classify countries. We will build models through
linear regression, and use cross-validation to choose the best one.

Visualization: In this part, we will use several different types of
graphs and tables to illustrate our results and present exploratory data
analysis. Histograms and boxplots will be used to show arranged
estimated control of corruption of each region from different years. The
tendency for each key variable will be presented by correlation and
scatter plots. Furthermore, the linear plots for each regression model
will be created to clarify the correlation between different variables
and the estimated control of corruption.

Coding Challenges: There are some expected coding challenges. In the
regression section, there might be some difficulties to code modeling
and the validation method such as cross-validation. Furthermore, there
will also be expected difficulties in setting up the website. We might
need to learn some new html elements and shiny app function.
